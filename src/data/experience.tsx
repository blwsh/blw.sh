          My professional career began at Ascensor. I started out modifying
          WordPress templates for brochure sites. I helped to develop a flow
          that enabled us to deliver tailored websites for small clients in as
          little as two days. Back then, I worked mainly with PHP, jQuery and
          SASS/SCSS.
